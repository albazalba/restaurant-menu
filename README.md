The following design elements have been added to enhance user experience:

1. **Cart Drawer**: An extra drawer has been implemented to display the contents of the user's basket.

2. **Cart Icon**: A cart icon has been added, which, when clicked, opens the cart drawer.

3. **Item Quantity Controls**:
   - "+" button: Increases the quantity of an item in the cart
   - "-" button: Decreases the quantity of an item in the cart or removes it if the quantity becomes zero

These additions provide a more interactive and user-friendly interface for managing the shopping cart.
